# Improved Detection of Fraud Cases for E-commerce and Bank Transactions

This project aims to improve fraud detection in e-commerce and bank transactions using machine learning techniques, including exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and explainability with SHAP.

## Project Structure

- `data/raw/`: Original datasets
- `data/processed/`: Cleaned and feature-engineered data
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA, feature engineering, modeling, and explainability
- `src/`: Source code for the fraud detection system
- `tests/`: Unit tests
- `models/`: Saved model artifacts
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory in order for a complete analysis.

## Notebooks

- `eda-fraud-data.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis on fraud data
- `eda-creditcard.ipynb`: EDA on credit card transactions
- `feature-engineering.ipynb`: Feature engineering steps
- `modeling.ipynb`: Model training and evaluation
- `shap-explainability.ipynb`: Model interpretability using SHAP
